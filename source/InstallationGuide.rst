Installation Guide
******************

If you want to use the API in your own project through Maven or JCenter, please follow the User installation guide (the first section). If you wish to contribute to the source code or compile the library locally for your project, please follow the Developer installation guide (the next section below).

User installation guide
=======================

This library is maintained in both JCenter and Maven. In order to use it in your project, you will need to add either one of these central repositories to your project. Please refer to the documentation of your IDE for more help. To add the dependency to this library, simple add the following dependency:

.. code:: bash

    fi.vtt.nubomedia:webrtcpeer-android:[version]
    
Where [version] is the latest edition available in the repository. You may find the versions in

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/fi.vtt.nubomedia/webrtcpeer-android

and 

https://bintray.com/nubomedia-vtt/maven/webrtcpeer-android

Developer installation guide
============================

This documents provides information how to compile the webrtcpeer-android library from the sources. This guide is also valid if you wish to compile the library locally for you project.

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Next, clone the project by using the command below:
